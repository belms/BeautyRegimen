MAKE-UP REMOVING CLEANSING OIL NEW
Our cleansers are having a makeover and become VINOCLEAN, a new line of eco-friendly cleansers, with vegan and highly natural formulas.
The Make-up Removing Cleansing Oil is a mix of 100% natural origin nourishing plant oils (sweet almond, castor, grape seed and sunflower oils).
It’s effective on all types of make-up, including waterproof, its clean, vegan formula gently removes make-up on the face, eyes and lips. It nourishes, cleanses and removes the skin’s impurities all while enhancing the eyelashes thanks to the castor oil. Perfect for effective and fast make-up removal without using cotton pads.
Its oil texture transforms into a milk on contact with water for easy and fast rinsing without leaving a greasy film on the skin.
Its 100% natural sweet almond fragrance makes make-up removal a really enjoyable moment of well-being.
