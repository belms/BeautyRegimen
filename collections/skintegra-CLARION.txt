CLARION
Exfoliating serum for combination / oily & acne-prone skin
Clarion is an exfoliating night serum designed for deep cleansing of pores and improving texture and hyperpigmentation on problematic skin prone to breakouts and comedones. This potent exfoliator has a minimalistic formula which includes 4% glycolic acid, 2% salicylic acid and liquorish, green tea and rhodiola extracts (pH 3.3).
The active components in this product normalise excessive secretion of sebum and reduce the negative effects of follicular hyperkeratosis (in other words, fights accumulation of dead skin cells around follicles which leads to clogged pores and in turn, clinically more serious skin conditions). Salicylic and glycolic acid have a synergistic keratolytic effect, preventing clogged pores and improving the functioning of acne-prone skin.
As a spot treatment against irregularities, Clarion may be used on all skin types but due to its specific ability to reduce sebum production, its use on the entire face is especially recommended for combination and oily skin. On oily, combination and sensitive skin it is recommended to first start using Clarion every other day to let the skin get accustomed to more frequent use, while users already used to AHA and BHA products will be able to use this exfoliator every night as a first step after cleansing.
Clarion has a watery texture which absorbs quickly and completely and a slightly acidic, herbal scent. After application of the serum it is recommended to nourish the skin well and use an SPF product during the day. Formulated without the addition of parabens, denaturated alcohol or ethanol, artificial fragrances, dyes and other irritants, it is packaged in an opaque glass container with dropper.
