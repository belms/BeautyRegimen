HYDRA B
Hydrating serum emulsion for dehydrated skin, all skin types
Hydra B is a serum emulsion which provides the skin with intensive hydration and at the same time strengthens its hydrolipidic barrier. What makes this product special is that it uses a luxurious low-molecular hyaluronic acid whose strong hydration properties are additionally improved by the clinically proven effects of a patented complex of natural origin ingredients (derived from wheat and wood). Further, vitamins B3 (niacinamide) and B5 (panthenol) along with ginkgo extract keep the skin plump and fresh.
United in Hydra B, these ingredients soften and smooth the skin while at the same time restricting transepidermal loss of water. They increase the level of naturally present moisture in the skin and promote synthesis of ceramides which keep the skin healthy.
Hydra B is ideal for all skin types as a key step in preventing dehydration. Used alone it functions on oily and combination skin after adequate toning, while on normal to dry skin it is ideal as a serum base for applying richer products on top, especially in the winter period. The product does not clog pores, itâ€™s hypoallergenic and suitable for sensitive skin. Upon application skin immediately feels hydrated while the gentle milky texture absorbs instantly leaving no oily or sticky residue behind. After applying the serum, it is recommended to apply an oil booster or moisturiser (ideally with SPF for daytime) while the face is still moist.
Hydra is formulated without the addition of parabens, fragrances, alcohol, artificial dyes and other irritants and is packaged in an airless bottle with pump dispenser which guards its ingredients against air and contamination in order to ensure that they remain fresh and highly efficient until used up. Its ingredients are not photosensitive.
