RADIANCE SERUM COMPLEXION CORRECTING
Millions of women have already been convinced by Caudalieâ€™s cult product,
the Vinoperfect Radiance Serum Complexion Correcting, for its exceptional anti-dark spot action.
In 2021, the Vinoperfect Radiance Serum Complexion Correcting has been reinvented, offering a more effective,
cleaner & natural formula. This serum corrects the appearance of existing dark spots and evens the complexion, making it brighter.
It is effective on all types of dark spots (sun, acne, melasma, age) and is suitable for all skin types, even the most sensitive.
It has a fresh, subtle fragrance, combining green notes of citron blossom, orange leaves, watermelon and crushed mint.
