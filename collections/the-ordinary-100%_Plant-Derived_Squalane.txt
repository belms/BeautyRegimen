100% Plant-Derived Squalane
Squalane is a saturated and stable hydrocarbon that is found naturally in the skin.
It has very high emollience, is an exceptional hydrator and can prevent ongoing loss of hydration that impairs dermal suppleness.
Squalane is non-comedogenic and is suitable for use on all skin types. It can also be applied to hair to increase heat protection,
add shine and reduce breakage potential.
Note: This product uses 100% pure plant-derived Squalane that is ECOCERT approved and is a USDA Certified Bio-based Product.
