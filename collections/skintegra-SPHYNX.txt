SPHYNX
Hydrating and plumping eye cream
Sphynx is a treatment gel-cream designed for the dry and sensitive eye area and is rich in vitamins, antioxidants and other soothing and repairing components. It is intended for preventive and corrective care for all skin types which may begin as early as in the mid-twenties.
Sphynx’s texture is silky, smoothing, fast-absorbing, hydrating and extremely gentle. Its carefully selected clinically tested active ingredients act against non-adequate cell functioning of the delicate skin in the eye area and correct it.
Sphynx deeply nourishes and moisturises the skin, increases its elasticity and reduces the depth of expression lines, discretely lightening dark circles and providing the skin with necessary vitamins and minerals in order to strengthen its natural defence mechanisms. A complex of peptides, ceramides, provitamins A, C and E, plant collagens, antioxidants and aminoacids synergically improves collagen and elastin synthesis, restores moisture levels and repairs skin and as a result, the eye area immediately looks more nourished and well rested.  
Sphynx’ comprehensive formula profile includes:
Panthenol and bisabolol– soothe and repair the delicate skin of the eye area
Ceramide precursors – repair and protect the delicate stratum corneum
Betaine– amino-acid which maintains moisture levels and has anti-irritation properties
Shea butter and jojoba esters  – stable emollients, protect the skin from dehydration
Tripeptides and tetrapeptides– clinically tested anti-age ingredients which reduce wrinkle depth and have an effect on synthesis of collagen, elastin, glycosaminoglycan and hyaluronic acid
Caffeine– potent vasoconstrictor and antioxidant
Plant collagen – strengthens intradermal structures and increases skin elasticity
Two forms of vitamin E – anti-oxidative and protective effects
Beta carotene– vitamin A precursor and antioxidant
Ascorbyl palmitate– vitamin C ester, anti-age, antioxidant and anti-hyperpigmentation agent
Aescin and chestnut extract – strengthen capillaries and veins reducing the visibility of dark circles
Camomile extract– rich in flavonoids, has a potent anti-inflammatory effect
