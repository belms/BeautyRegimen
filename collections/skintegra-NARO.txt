NARO
100% plant derived squalane booster
Squalane is a naturally present component of human sebum whose production significantly decreases after the age of 20, resulting in reduced elasticity of the skin. To put it simply, skin becomes less plump, more dry and lifeless. It is then recommended to restore squalene to the skin since it hydrates, nourishes and softens it in a way which is bioidentical to the way sebum does, at the same time providing it with additional essential fatty acids and an anti-oxidative effect.
In Naro squalane is derived from olive oil but unlike olive oil it does not leave a heavy film on the skin, does not have its characteristic scent nor does it contribute to clogging pores. This makes it ideal for use on all skin types, including those prone to breakouts. Applied to a moist face or one already nourished by a serum or cream, squalane helps prevent the loss of moisture from the skin and in this way assists in preserving the skin’s healthy hydrolipidic barrier.
Squalane derived from olive oil differs from classic oils by the fact that it’s extremely stable and has low chemical reactivity which is extremely important when we know that oxidised or rancid oils have the potential to irritate the skin. The product is completely natural, without the addition of parabens, denaturated alcohol or ethanol, artificial fragrances, dyes and other irritants and is packaged in a glass container.
