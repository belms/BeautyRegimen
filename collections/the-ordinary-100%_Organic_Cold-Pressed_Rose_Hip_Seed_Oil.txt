100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil
This formulation uses 100% pure Rosehip Seed Oil that is both cold-pressed and organic.
Rosehip Seed Oil is rich in linoleic acid, linolenic acid and pro-vitamin A, all of which degrade when the oil extraction
process involves heat. While cold-pressed extraction is complex, it preserves all of the quality of this important oil
which has been shown to reduce signs of photo-aging and many other skin conditions.
Notes: Supplied in UV-protective packaging.
Our Rose Hip Seed Oil is completely unrefined and imparts a natural scent partly due to its high omega fatty acid content.
This scent is not an indication of rancidity. Rose Hip Seed Oil that does not have a scent is refined and offers reduced benefits.
