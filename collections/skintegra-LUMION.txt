LUMION
Exfoliating toner for tired, congested and ageing skin all skin types
Lumion is a non-drying, night time exfoliant of medium intensity based on AHA and PHA acids. It is intended for all skin types including mature skin, but excluding sensitive skin.  Skin with visible hyperpigmentation marks, including those caused by sun exposure, and skin with impaired texture lacking freshness and luminosity will gain multiple benefits from the use of Lumion.
Formulated with a combination of AHA (lactic and glycolic) and PHA (in the form of gluconolactone), Lumion is highly efficient in exfoliating the surface skin layers, softening hard skin and evening out its tone. As we get older, squamous cells begin to peel less efficiently from the surface of the skin and they need a little assistance to restore their normal desquamation function. Aiding the skin in that natural process, Lumion refines the skinâ€™s texture and evens out its tone. By thorough exfoliation of a medium-strength intensity, Lumion efficiently prepares the skin for the application of other topical products.
In addition to the AHA and PHA complex, the product is enriched with glycerine which hydrates and panthenol and oat extract which soothe the skin. Formulated without the addition of parabens, fragrances, alcohol, artificial dyes and other irritants Lumion is packaged in an elegant glass bottle which guards its ingredients against air and contamination in order to ensure that they remain fresh and highly efficient until used up. Its ingredients are not photosensitive.
