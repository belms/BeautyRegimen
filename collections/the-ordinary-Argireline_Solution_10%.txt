Argireline Solution 10%
Arigreline is a trademark owned by Barcelona-based Lipotec. It is a proprietary solution of Acetyl Hexapeptide-8. Controlled studies have shown that Argireline improves the appearance of facial areas prone to developing dynamic folds, including around the eyes and in the forehead area.
Note: Studies have shown that the water content of formulations does impact the utility level of topical Argireline and specifically that higher water content results in better utility. This formulation is water-based and avoids oils, esters and silicones.
Note:
We are deeply grateful to our devoted customers for loving us and our products so much. Our lab has and continues to devote countless hours to share the newest innovations with our broader world. The Ordinary now offers a wide range of products under the Vitamin C, Peptide and Direct Acid categories, and to help our ever-growing, loving family of users build functional and effective routines incorporating these products we have developed an introductory guideline into the brand.
Previously, we did not have a contraindication listed for the use of direct acids/Vitamin C with any of our peptides. However, we now have a huge arsenal of these products and some of the formulations are more susceptible to hydrolysis with certain types of Vitamin C or acids.
Instead of developing a complex guide listing the compatibility of each of our peptides with each acid and Vitamin C, we have adapted the following approach to maximize efficacy for the maximum number of people:
It is best to not use Peptides in the same routine as the following products: Direct acids, LAA (L-Ascorbic Acid) and ELAA (Ethylated Ascorbic Acid). In addition, we would recommend avoiding the use of products containing copper peptides in the same routine as strong antioxidants as well as direct acids/LAA/ELAA.
