Squalane Cleanser
A gentle cleansing product formulated to target makeup removal whilst leaving the skin feeling smooth and moisturized.
The formula incorporates Squalane, alongside other lipophilic esters that are gentle, moisturizing,
efficient in dissolving makeup and facial impurities and increasing the spreadability of the product.
When rubbed between your palms for approximately 10-30 seconds, the product undergoes an important textural change from a balm-like consistency to a clear oil-like consistency. This allows the emulsifying sucrose esters in the formula to trap and blend the dissolved makeup and facial impurities with water for rinsing. Being non-comedogenic and soap-free, this formula is designed to be gentle enough for daily use, without over-drying the skin, making it suitable for all skin types.
