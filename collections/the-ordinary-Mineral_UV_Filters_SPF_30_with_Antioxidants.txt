Mineral UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants
The Ordinary range of Mineral UV Filters formulas’ offer SPF protection along with antioxidant, hydration, and anti-irritant support.
The Mineral UV Filter formulas avoid the use of any nanoparticles. Instead, a refined dispersion of micronized ZnO and TiO2 in flexible, high-volatility, non-comedogenic silicones allows the formulations to remain extremely lightweight by optimizing the amount of the blocking agents. Our formulation uses mainly ZnO for its protective effects (because in addition to reflecting/refracting light, ZnO is actually also able to absorb UV rays without creating oxygen radicals) and the supporting TiO2 that it contains is only in rutile form (no anatase form of TiO2 is used at all since it's an aggressive producer of free radicals).
The technologies shared in Mineral UV Filter Formulas’ are:
Bio-Active Antioxidant Network
A potent combination that scavenges and neutralizes free radicals, minimizes the intensity of UV radiation penetrating the skin, visibly protects biological membranes and supports the skin response to UV exposure.
Bio-Sugar Complex
A unique blend of hygroscopic molecules with Multi-layer coverage providing both short and long-term hydration and also naturally increases skin’s own capacity to hold water.
Skin Identical Lipids
Lipids that visibly restore the compromised barrier and prevents transepidermal water loss (TEWL).
Tasmanian Pepperberry
Rich in flavanones, anthocyanins, and minerals, this active technology helps to calm stressed skin, acting almost immediately.
